## Summary

End User Computing specialist with 11+ years designing, automating, and operating VDI and device management platforms. I help teams move from manual runbooks to repeatable, observable pipelines—reducing outages and shortening time-to-productivity for end users. I prefer pragmatic automation (Ansible, PowerShell, Packer) that delivers measurable operational improvements and makes on-call less stressful. I enjoy mentoring engineers and building processes that scale across sites and cloud environments.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Specialist, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
**Breezeline** | *October 2025 – Present*
- Promoted to lead the VDI practice and represent EUC in architecture and operational planning. I focus on turning one-off fix-it tasks into repeatable processes that reduce firefighting.
- Own the enterprise VDI platform supporting roughly 1,500 users; introduced automation-first practices for desktop deployments, Linux pool provisioning, and standardized onboarding.
- Grew Ansible-driven automation to include Linux image pipelines, App Volumes orchestration, and API-driven Windows 11 builds—combining Ansible, PowerShell, and vendor APIs to speed image refreshes and reduce manual steps.
- Built a PowerShell module library to centralize common admin tasks, reporting, and image maintenance workflows so engineers spend less time on routine operations.
- Led thin-client strategy for 10ZiG devices, adding automated provisioning, drift detection, and simplified firmware management to lower device-related incidents.
- Implemented Workspace ONE Access with Google Workspace SSO for consistent sign-on across DaaS and VDI services.
- Operationalized Veeam backups for management and infrastructure servers, and authored DR playbooks and recovery validation checks for critical services.
- Designed repeatable onboarding for cloud DaaS users—standardizing provisioning, entitlements, application mapping, and first-touch support to accelerate readiness.
- Built monitoring and remediation playbooks using ControlUp and Semaphore to catch recurring user experience issues and reduce escalations to Tier 3.

### VDI Systems Engineer
**Breezeline** | *September 2023 – October 2025*
- Helped establish a disciplined, iterative delivery process across production, staging, and development VDI environments using Kanban and user stories.
- Managed 10ZiG thin-client deployment and lifecycle workstreams including imaging and firmware updates, bringing consistency to remote device fleets.
- Developed IaC and automation pipelines with HashiCorp Packer, Ansible, and PowerShell to speed image builds and lower manual packaging work for App Volumes.
- Deployed Workspace ONE Access and Google Workspace SSO integrations to simplify authentication and improve reliability for published apps.
- Built backup and recovery processes with Veeam for management and infrastructure servers and golden images, and ran regular DR validation exercises.
- Rolled out DEM and App Volumes improvements to reduce logon issues and profile corruption, improving day-one experience for users.
- Produced runbooks and training material to transfer knowledge and formalize Tier 3 troubleshooting steps.

### Senior Systems Engineer & Systems Engineer
**United States Senate Federal Credit Union** | *March 2020 – September 2023*
- Led EUC efforts to support remote work during COVID-19, deploying Workspace UEM, SSO, and VDI solutions that supported 150+ remote staff.
- Improved Windows provisioning with custom images, Autopilot, and Configuration Manager to ensure consistent, secure user workstations.
- Partnered with SecOps and networking to plan and execute upgrades and production changes while meeting strict uptime targets.
- Built automation (PowerShell, Bash) and maintained repositories in Git/Azure DevOps for repeatable operations and fewer manual errors.
- Designed training, documentation, and playbooks to reduce escalations and speed onboarding for new engineers.

### Systems Administrator
**United States Senate Federal Credit Union** | *September 2016 – March 2020*
- Supported VMware Workspace One SSO, Horizon VDI, and MDM components to establish a reliable EUC foundation for ~120 employees.
- Managed multi-platform endpoints (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android) and helped transition the business toward a zero-trust model.
- Automated patching and configuration management with SCCM/WSUS and authored scripts to detect and remediate common issues.
- Maintained virtual infrastructure (vSphere/multi-vCenter) and contributed to cross-team operational improvements.

### Earlier Experience
**Technical Support & Network Technician Roles** | Various Employers | *2009 – 2016*

- Worked in frontline technical support and network roles, gaining hands-on experience in imaging, troubleshooting, and customer-facing problem solving.
